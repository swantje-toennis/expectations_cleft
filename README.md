### Clefts address unexpected questions
#### by Swantje Tönnis and Judith Tonhauser (University of Stuttgart)

This repository contains all materials for our study investigating Tönnis' (2021) hypothesis that clefts address relatively 
unexpected questions in discourse while canonical sentences address relatively expected questions in discourse. We conducted a norming study to measure relative expectedness of questions in discourse, and a study testing the relative preference between the cleft and its canonical variant depending on the expectedness of the question which is answered by the cleft/canonical sentence. The results will be published in the SALT32 proceedings. The paper submission can be found in this repository in the folder [writing](https://github.com/swantje-toennis/expectations_cleft/tree/main/writing).

The folder "experiments" contain as all details about the norming study and the cleft experiment, details (including Supplement A and Supplement B) of the final study are [here](https://github.com/swantje-toennis/expectations_cleft/tree/main/experiments/main).

The results of the two studies (data, figures, and R scripts) can be found [here](https://github.com/swantje-toennis/expectations_cleft/tree/main/results/main).
